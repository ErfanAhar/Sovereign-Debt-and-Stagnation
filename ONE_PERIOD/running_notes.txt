To discuss with RA
1) GNU Fortran compiler.  It's free and good.  We'll stick to using this compiler.  Please get it on your computer

2) grid bounds are part of parameter declation.
3) I kept some parameters that we are not using now, may may eventually 

4) Some functions are in the Toolbox or Toolbox_CE.  Let me know if you don't find them.
	Among them: vsearch_FET finds the closest point on the grid.
